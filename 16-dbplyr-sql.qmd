```{r}
install.packages("DBI")
install.packages("duckdb")

library(DBI)
library(duckdb)
con <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb())
```

```{r}
library(here)
duckdb_read_csv(conn = con, name = "tennis2018", 
                files = here("data/atp_matches_2018.csv"))
duckdb_read_csv(conn = con, name = "tennis2019", 
                files = here("data/atp_matches_2019.csv"))

dbListTables(con)
```

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

sql <- "
  SELECT surface, winner_name, loser_name, w_ace, l_ace, minutes
  FROM tennis2019 
  WHERE minutes > 240
"
dbGetQuery(con, sql) |>
  as_tibble()
```

Exercise 1. It is keeping the variables specified in the SELECT statement from the tennis2019 data set and it is then keeping the matches that were longer than 240 minutes.

Exercise 2. `WHERE` is similar to `filter()` while `SELECT` is similar to `select()` in this example.

## Section 16.2: `dbplyr`

```{r}
library(dbplyr)

## create a database table of the tennis2019 data set
## in our database connection con
tennis_db <- tbl(con, "tennis2019")
tennis_db
## top of printout:
## gives us the number of columns (49) but not rows
## tells us what database we are connected to (DuckDB v.....)

```

```{r}
tennis_query1 <- tennis_db |> 
  filter(minutes > 240) |> 
  select(minutes, winner_name, loser_name, minutes, tourney_name)
tennis_query1
## returns this "database" object with ??? rows

## if we want to turn this into a regular "tibble", we
## can use `collect()`
tennis_query1 |> collect()
## no longer in a database and we can now treat this
## just as a regular dataframe in R
```

```{r}
tennis_query1 |>
  show_query()
## shows equivalent SQL code for our dbplyr query in 
## dplyr code
```

```{r}
totalaces <- tennis_db |>
  group_by(winner_name) |>
  summarise(total_aces = sum(w_ace)) |>
  arrange(desc(total_aces))
totalaces

totalaces |> show_query()
## ORDER BY is like arrange() and DESC is like desc()
## GROUP BY winner_name is like group_by(winner_name)
## SUM(w_ace) AS total_aces is like summarise(total_aces = ...)
```

Exercise 3.

```{r}
count_matches <- tennis_db |> group_by(surface) |>
  summarise(n_matches = n())

count_matches |> show_query()
## COUNT(*) is equivalent to n()
```

## Section 16.3: SQL

* `SELECT` covers:

    * `select()` from dplyr to keep certain columns
    * `rename()`. In SQL, new_name AS old_name renames a column called old_name to now be callew new_name
    * `mutate()` x + y AS new_name
    * `summarise()` AVG('minutes') AS mean_min
    
* `FROM`: which data set in the database you are using (tennis2019)

* `WHERE`: equivalent to `filter()`

* `GROUP BY`: equivalent to `group_by()`

* `ORDER BY`: equivalent to `arrange()`

Exercise 4.

```{r}
wimb <- tennis_db |> filter(tourney_name == "Wimbledon")
wimb |> show_query()
```

## Class Exercises

Class Exercise 1.

```{r}
ace_diff_q <- tennis_db |> select(winner_name, loser_name, w_ace, l_ace) |>
  mutate(ace_diff = w_ace - l_ace) |>
  arrange(desc(ace_diff))
ace_diff_q |> show_query()
```

Class Exercise 2.

```{r}
test_query <- tennis_db |>
  mutate(points_diff = winner_rank_points - loser_rank_points) |>
  select(points_diff, winner_name, loser_name)
test_query |> show_query()
```

## Your Turn 

Your Turn 1.

```{r}
longest_match_query <- tennis_db |> group_by(tourney_name) |>
  summarise(longest_match = max(minutes))
longest_match_query |> show_query()
```
