## Your Turn

Your Turn 1

* In part (c), he deletes some outliers without explicitly saying that he did so.

* The y-axis limits were adjusted using point-and-click.

* He used the t.test function in Excel, but he may not report what function he used.

Your Turn 2

```{r}
library(babynames)
library(tidyverse)
babynames_5 <- babynames |>
  filter((name == "Matthew" & sex == "M") | 
           (name == "Jessica" & sex == "F") |
           (name == "Ivan" & sex == "M") |
           (name == "Robin" & sex == "M") |
           (name == "Michael" & sex == "M"))

library(ggrepel)
babynames_label <- babynames_5 |>
  filter(year == max(year))
ggplot(data = babynames_5, aes(x = year, y = n,
                               colour = name)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_label_repel(data = babynames_, aes(label = name)) +
  scale_colour_viridis_d() +
  theme_minimal()

## Your Turn 3

  rename(car_name = rowname)
mtcars_high <- mtcars |> filter(mpg == max(mpg))
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
