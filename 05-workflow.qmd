## Class Exercises

Class Exercise 1. This is not a reproducible workflow. Loading packages with point-and-click operations means that someone else would not be able to explicitly see all of the code needed to complete your analysis.

Class Exercises 2 and 3

```{r}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = drat)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = factor(gear))) +
  facet_wrap(~ cyl) +
  geom_smooth()

library(palmerpenguins)
penguins |> mutate(flipper_ratio = flipper_length_mm / body_mass_g) |>
  group_by(species, island) |>
  summarise(mean_flipper = mean(flipper_ratio, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  arrange(mean_flipper) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = c("species"), values_from = "mean_flipper")
```

Class Exercise 4.

```{r}
library(here)
videogame_df <- read_csv(here("data/videogame_clean.csv"))

videogame_df |>
  summarise(mean_pt = mean(median_playtime, na.rm = TRUE),
            med_pt = median(median_playtime, na.rm = TRUE))

videogame_df |> filter(median_playtime < 1000) |>
  summarise(mean_pt = mean(median_playtime, na.rm = TRUE),
            med_pt = median(median_playtime, na.rm = TRUE))

## mean is smaller but median stays the same
## mean is more affected by extreme outliers while the median
## is more robust to outliers.
