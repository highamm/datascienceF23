## Class Exercises

Class Exercise 1. Not putting your name on something (but giving other possibly identifiable information) does not necessarily mean that your data can't be traced back to you.

Class Exercise 2. For b and d, it would be not ethical because we've possibly provided too much information so that someone could obtain another student's grade.

For a, I would lean toward this being not ethical because you never know if someone would be to trace the canvas time back to someone's GPA.

For c, I would lean toward this being okay, as Major is often public and the other variables are not that sensitive.

## Your Turn

Your Turn 1. For hypothesis confirmation, we're usually answering one specific question of interest (think about a hypothesis test setting in STAT 113). Hypothesis generation/exploration usually is more flexible in that we can explore many different questions of interest with the same data set.

Your Turn 2. For hypothesis confirmation, we only use each observation once. For generation, we can use them as many times as we want.

Your Turn 3.

a. Hypothesis confirmation (we have one specific question of interest).

b. Hypothesis generation (using each observation more than once for each new question of interest).

c. Hypothesis generation (using each observation more than once to answer different seasonal trend questions).
