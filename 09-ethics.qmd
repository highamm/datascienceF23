## Class Exercises

Class Exercise 1. The purpose of this activity on course evaluations is to show that just because you do not put your name on something does not necessarily mean that that can't be traced back to you if you provide enough other identifying information.

Class Exercise 2.

b and d would be most inappropriate ethically because there is perhaps enough other identifying information that you would be able to determine what another student's grade in the class is.

a is more hazy ethically: there's not as much identifying information but it is still sharing student grades in the course that have a admittedly very low chance of being traced back to a student.

c seems more appropriate as it doesn't include any "sensitive" information like grade.
